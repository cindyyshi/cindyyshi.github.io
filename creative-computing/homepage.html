     <center><P1>I'm an nineteen-year-old student, who recently moved to New York City to discover myself as an aspiring artist. Through attending Parsons, The New School of Design and majoring in Communication Design.I was born in Beijing, China and moved to Toronto, Canada as a young child. Toronto's diversity in cultures and religions has contributed to the whole of who I am as an artist, it had made me view art not as a form of entertainment, but as a from of communication. I attended an intensive arts high school which I mainly pratised mostly fine arts but later turning to digital work, I am knowledgable about a variety of methods of expression. As I continue my path at Parsons, my art is evolving in to what I hope will contribute back to society in a positive and effective way.I’ve always had a fascination with the fashion industry, how it functions and revolve to what it is today. I hope to get into branding, advising and editorials for a fashion house or a magazine. I strongly believe having a campus as New York City will contribute to my goals and becoming my stepping stone to what I wish to achieve. </P1></center>
